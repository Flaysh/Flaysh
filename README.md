## About

Full Stack Engineer with 6+ years building production web applications with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I take features from definition to production with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience.

Outside of code, I perform as **FLAYSH**—an audiovisual artist blending sound, visuals, and technology into high-energy experiences. My sets revolve around drum and bass, IDM, and psychedelic bass, paired with projection mapping and live visuals using CRTs, security cams, and unconventional setups.

## Audiovisual

**FLAYSH** — DJ, VJ, projection mapper, and electronic music producer.

I create full-spectrum experiences that blur the line between analog and digital. Repurposing CRTs, security cameras, and unconventional gear to build surreal, tactile environments. Every show is designed for impact, movement, and deep connection.

**Sound:** Drum & Bass | IDM | Psychedelic Bass | Leftfield
**Visuals:** Projection Mapping | Live VJing | Generative Art | Hardware Hacking
